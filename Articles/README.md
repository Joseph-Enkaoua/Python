# 📑 Django Articles project

Welcome to my Django Articles project. This project focuses on mastering advanced functionalities in Django, including generic views, internationalization, and automated testing.

## 🐝 Key Takeaways

This project strengthened my ability to develop full-featured Django applications, optimize user interactions, and implement scalable architectures with automation, security, and internationalization in mind.

## 💪 What I Learned

Through a series of exercises, I gained hands-on experience with:

* Generic Views: Implementing a fully functional site using Django's built-in class-based views.

* User Authentication & Permissions: Managing users, login/logout, and access restrictions.

* Article Management System: Creating, displaying, and handling user-generated content efficiently.

* Favorite System: Allowing users to save and manage favorite articles.

* Bootstrap for UI Design: Enhancing the project’s interface with a consistent and responsive design.

* Internationalization (i18n): Implementing multi-language support based on URL prefixes.

* Automated Testing: Writing Django tests to verify functionality and security.
