# ðŸ’¬ Django Chat project

Welcome to my Django Chat project. This project focuses on mastering real-time communication in Django using AJAX and WebSockets.

## ðŸ’ª What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

* AJAX-based Authentication: Implementing login and logout functionality without page refresh.

* Real-time Chat System: Building a WebSocket-powered chat application in Django.

* Message Persistence & History: Storing and displaying chat history to users.

* User Presence Tracking: Managing connected users and updating live user lists.

* Dynamic UI with jQuery: Handling frontend interactivity using jQuery.

* Automatic Scroll Management: Keeping chat view at the latest message.
