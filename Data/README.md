# ðŸ“€ Django Data project

Welcome to my Django Data project. The project focuses on mastering data management in Django using both Django's ORM and raw SQL with the Psycopg2 library.

## ðŸ“Œ What I Learned

Through a series of exercises, I gained hands-on experience with:

* Database Management in Django: Creating and structuring databases using Django Models and raw SQL queries.

* Django ORM: Defining models, querying data efficiently, and managing relationships between tables.

* Raw SQL with Psycopg2: Executing SQL commands directly within Django to manipulate databases.

* CRUD Operations: Implementing create, read, update, and delete functionality for structured datasets.

* Form Handling & User Interaction: Creating interactive views that allow users to modify and interact with database records.

* Foreign Keys & Many-to-Many Relationships: Managing complex relationships between entities using Django's ORM.

* Data Validation & Error Handling: Ensuring database integrity and handling errors effectively.
