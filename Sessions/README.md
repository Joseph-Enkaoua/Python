# ðŸ‘¾ Django Session project

Welcome to my Django Session project. This project focuses on mastering user authentication, session management, and permissions in Django.

## ðŸ’ª What I Learned

Through a series of exercises, I gained hands-on experience with:

* Anonymous Sessions: Implementing temporary usernames with expiration policies.

* User Authentication: Creating a registration and login system with session handling.

* User-Generated Content: Developing a Tip system with Django models and forms.

* Voting Mechanism: Implementing upvotes, downvotes, and ensuring integrity.

* Access Control & Permissions: Restricting actions based on user roles and reputation.

* Custom Permissions & Automated Privileges: Creating a dynamic authorization system based on user contributions.

* Django Admin & Custom User Model: Managing permissions efficiently and extending Djangoâ€™s default user system.
